#### **üìä Mathematical Foundation**
```cpp
// Distance calculation between two circles
float distance = sqrt((pos1.x - pos2.x)¬≤ + (pos1.y - pos2.y)¬≤);

// Collision condition
if (distance < (radius1 + radius2)) {
    // Collision detected - objects are overlapping
    collision_detected = true;
}
```

#### **üîç Implementation Details**

- **Numerical Accuracy**: Uses double-precision floating-point for exact distance calculations

- **Broad Phase Potential**: Could be enhanced with spatial partitioning for improved performance with large object counts

### üèÄ Collision Resolution System

#### **‚ö° Impulse-Based Response**
The collision resolution uses momentum conservation principles:
```cpp
// Calculate relative velocity along collision normal
Vector2 relativeVelocity = velocity1 - velocity2;
float velocityAlongNormal = dot(relativeVelocity, collisionNormal);

// Calculate impulse scalar
float restitution = 0.8f;  // Bounciness factor
float impulseScalar = -(1 + restitution) * velocityAlongNormal;
impulseScalar /= (inverseMass1 + inverseMass2);

// Apply impulse to both objects
Vector2 impulse = collisionNormal * impulseScalar;
velocity1 += impulse * inverseMass1;
velocity2 -= impulse * inverseMass2;
```

#### **üîß Separation Algorithm**
Prevents object overlap and sticking:
```cpp
// Calculate penetration depth
float penetration = (radius1 + radius2) - distance;
Vector2 separation = collisionNormal * (penetration / 2.0f);

// Move objects apart to prevent overlap
position1 += separation;
position2 -= separation;
```

### üîÑ Euler Integration Method

#### **üìê Mathematical Basis**
The simulation uses first-order Euler integration:
```cpp
// Update velocity using acceleration
velocity = velocity + acceleration * deltaTime;

// Update position using velocity  
position = position + velocity * deltaTime;

// Reset acceleration for next frame
acceleration = Vector2(0, 0);
```
